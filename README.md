# CapyCapyNews 🧠📰

**News Tagged by the Chillest Rodent Alive.**

CapyCapyNews is a lightweight news analysis tool that fetches headlines from German sources, tags them with political alignment (Left, Center, Right), and visualizes bias using a chill capybara-themed interface — because the world’s serious enough already.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project does **not** represent or promote any political opinion. It’s built purely for **educational purposes** — especially for **foreigners living in Germany** — to better understand how news is framed and where sources might lean.
